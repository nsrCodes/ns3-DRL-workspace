 * \ingroup cam-managers
 * \brief Class that implements the generic LBT channel access manager algorithm.
 *
 * Subclasses of NrLbtAccessManager implement different categories of the LBT
 * algorithm. The categories of LBT algorithm according to 3GPP TR 38.889 V1.0.0
 * (2018-11), Section 8.2. are 1, 2, 3 and 4. Category 1 represents
 * the switching gap from the reception to transmission,
 * so it is not considered as a specific sub-type of LBT CAM algorithm.
 * Cat. 2 means that LBT executes without a random back-off, i.e. the
 * LBT procedure is done for a deterministic amount of time, e.g. 25 us.
 * Cat. 3 means that there is a random back-off but the contention window (CW)
 * is fixed; and Cat. 4 means that there is a random back-off and the CW is
 * variable.
